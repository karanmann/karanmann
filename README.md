## Hi there 👋 I'm Karan 

Born and raised in India surrounded by MS-DOS and command lines 💻, living in Sweden. Somehow I diverged from my passion in coding. I'm a __FrontEnd developer__ in the making, computers were always a passion. Now I have jumped to the oppertunity to working with my passion.	


 - 📚 I’m currently attending a __Front Development Course.__ 
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning: __HTML, CSS, JavaScript, focusing mainly on React__.	
 - 🌈 I also love to learn new talents!
 - 👨‍🍳 I am a classically trained chef from Le Cordon Blue, London
 - 💥 I'm __curious__ and eager to learn new skills.	 
 - ⚡ Fun fact: I love cooking and fishing.
