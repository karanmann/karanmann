## Hi there 👋 I'm Karan 

Born and raised in India surrounded by MS-DOS and command lines 💻, living in Sweden. Somehow I diverged from my passion in coding. I'm a __Fullstack developer__ in the making, computers were always a passion. Now I have jumped to the oppertunity to working with my passion.	

 
 - 🌱 Tech : __HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Mongoose, Node.js and Redux Toolkit focusing mainly on React__.	
 
 - 🌈 I also love to travel especially Road Trips!
 
 - 👨‍🍳 I am a classically trained chef from __Le Cordon Blue, London__
 
 - 💥 I'm __curious__ and eager to __learn new skills__.	 
 
 - ⚡ Fun fact: I travelled all over europe by road.
